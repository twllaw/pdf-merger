# pdf-merger
This is a no-frills Windows console app, where you combine multiple PDFs into one PDF!

**How does it work?**

1. Put your PDFs in a folder
2. Specify that folder path when prompted, or put it in the `App.config` file
3. Specify the file name for your combined PDF document
4. The new PDF file will then be created in that same folder!
